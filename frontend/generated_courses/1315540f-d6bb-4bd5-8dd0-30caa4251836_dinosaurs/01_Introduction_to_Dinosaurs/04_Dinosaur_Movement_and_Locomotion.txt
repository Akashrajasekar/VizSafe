# Dinosaur Movement and Locomotion

## Key Concepts

- Walking
- Running
- Swimming

## Explanations

Dinosaurs, like all living organisms, needed to move and interact with their environment to survive. The movement and locomotion of dinosaurs are not well understood, but it is likely that they used a combination of walking, running, and swimming to move around. Walking was likely the primary mode of locomotion for most dinosaurs, as it allowed them to conserve energy and move efficiently over long distances.

## Examples

- The Brachiosaurus, a sauropod dinosaur, had a long neck and tail that allowed it to move efficiently over long distances.
- The Tyrannosaurus Rex, a theropod dinosaur, had powerful legs that allowed it to run quickly and catch prey.
- The Hadrosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur, had webbed feet that allowed it to swim efficiently.

## Summary Points

- Dinosaurs used a combination of walking, running, and swimming to move around.
- Walking was likely the primary mode of locomotion for most dinosaurs.
- The movement and locomotion of dinosaurs were adapted to their specific environments and lifestyles.
