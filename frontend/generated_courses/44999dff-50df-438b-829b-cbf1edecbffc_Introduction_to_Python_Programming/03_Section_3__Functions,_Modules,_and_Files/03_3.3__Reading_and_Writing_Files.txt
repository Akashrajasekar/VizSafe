# 3.3: Reading and Writing Files

## Key Concepts

- Text files
- CSV files
- JSON files
- File modes

## Explanations

In Python, you can work with files using the 'open' function, which returns a file object. The 'open' function takes two arguments: the file name and the file mode. The file mode specifies how the file should be opened, such as 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, or 'a' for appending. Once a file is opened, you can read or write to it using the 'read' or 'write' methods.

## Examples

- Example: Open a text file called 'example.txt' in read mode and print its contents.
- Example: Open a CSV file called 'data.csv' in read mode and print its contents.
- Example: Open a JSON file called 'config.json' in read mode and print its contents.

## Summary Points

- Files can be opened using the 'open' function
- The 'open' function takes two arguments: the file name and the file mode
- Files can be read or written using the 'read' or 'write' methods
- Different types of files, such as text files, CSV files, and JSON files, can be worked with in Python
