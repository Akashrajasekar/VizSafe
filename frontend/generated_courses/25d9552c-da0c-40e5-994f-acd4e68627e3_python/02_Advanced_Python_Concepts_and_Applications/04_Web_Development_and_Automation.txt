# Web Development and Automation

## Key Concepts

- Flask
- Django
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup

## Explanations

Web development is the process of building web applications using programming languages like Python. In Python, we can use frameworks like Flask and Django to build web applications. Flask is a microframework that provides a lightweight way to build web applications, while Django is a high-level framework that provides an architecture, templates, and APIs for building complex web applications.

## Examples

- Creating a Flask app: from flask import Flask; app = Flask(__name__)
- Sending an HTTP request: import requests; response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')
- Parsing HTML using BeautifulSoup: from bs4 import BeautifulSoup; soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

## Summary Points

- Flask is a microframework for building web applications
- Django is a high-level framework for building complex web applications
- Requests is a library for sending HTTP requests
- BeautifulSoup is a library for parsing HTML and XML documents
- We can use Python to automate tasks such as web scraping and data extraction
