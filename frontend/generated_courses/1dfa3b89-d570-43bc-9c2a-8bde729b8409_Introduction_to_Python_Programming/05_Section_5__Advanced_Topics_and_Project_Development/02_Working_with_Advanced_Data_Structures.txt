# Working with Advanced Data Structures

## Key Concepts

- sets
- dictionaries
- data structures

## Explanations

In Python, we have several advanced data structures that can be used to store and manipulate data. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, and they can be used to store a group of items without duplicates. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, and they can be used to store data with a specific key or identifier.

## Examples

- Creating a set: colors = set(['red', 'green', 'blue'])
- Creating a dictionary: person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
- Using the get() method: print(person.get('name'))

## Summary Points

- Sets are unordered collections of unique elements
- Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs
- Sets can be used to store a group of unique items
- Dictionaries can be used to store data with a specific key or identifier
- Sets and dictionaries have various methods that can be used to manipulate the data
