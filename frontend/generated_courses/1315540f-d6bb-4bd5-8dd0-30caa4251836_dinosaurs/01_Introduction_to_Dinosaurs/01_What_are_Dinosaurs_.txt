# What are Dinosaurs?

## Key Concepts

- Definition of dinosaurs
- Skeletal system
- Skin and scales

## Explanations

Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that dominated Earth's landscapes during the Mesozoic Era. They are defined by their unique characteristics, such as their skeletal system, which includes hollow bones, three-toed limbs, and hip structures. Dinosaurs also had skin and scales, which provided protection and helped regulate their body temperature. The skeletal system of dinosaurs is an important aspect of their biology, as it allowed them to move and support their bodies. For example, the hollow bones of dinosaurs made them lighter and more efficient for movement. The skin and scales of dinosaurs also played a crucial role in their survival, as they helped to protect them from the environment and regulate their body temperature.

## Examples

- The Tyrannosaurus Rex, a large carnivorous dinosaur, had powerful legs and sharp teeth.
- The Stegosaurus, a plant-eating dinosaur, had a row of plates on its back and spikes on its tail.
- The Velociraptor, a small carnivorous dinosaur, had sharp claws on its feet.

## Summary Points

- Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that dominated Earth's landscapes during the Mesozoic Era.
- Dinosaurs are defined by their unique characteristics, such as their skeletal system and skin.
- The skeletal system of dinosaurs includes hollow bones, three-toed limbs, and hip structures.
