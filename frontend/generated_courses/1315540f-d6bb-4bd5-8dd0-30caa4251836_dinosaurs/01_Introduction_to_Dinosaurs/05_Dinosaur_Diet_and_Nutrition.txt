- Herbivory
- Carnivory
- Omnivory

## Explanations

Dinosaurs, like all living organisms, needed to eat and obtain nutrients to survive. The diet and nutrition of dinosaurs are not well understood, but it is likely that they included a variety of plants and animals. Herbivorous dinosaurs, such as the sauropods and hadrosaurs, likely ate plants and fruits to obtain nutrients. Carnivorous dinosaurs, such as the theropods, likely ate other animals to obtain nutrients.

## Examples

- The Brachiosaurus, a sauropod dinosaur, likely ate leaves and fruits from high in the trees.
- The Tyrannosaurus Rex, a theropod dinosaur, likely ate other animals to obtain nutrients.
- The Hadrosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur, likely ate a variety of plants and fruits, and may have even used its beak to filter small particles from the water.

## Summary Points

- Dinosaurs had a variety of diets, including herbivory, carnivory, and omnivory.
- Herbivorous dinosaurs likely ate plants and fruits to obtain nutrients.
- The diet and nutrition of dinosaurs were adapted to their specific environments and lifestyles.
