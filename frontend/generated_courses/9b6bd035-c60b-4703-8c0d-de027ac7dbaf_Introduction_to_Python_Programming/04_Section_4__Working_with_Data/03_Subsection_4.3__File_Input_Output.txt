# Subsection 4.3: File Input/Output

## Key Concepts

- Files
- Reading files
- Writing files
- File modes
- Exceptions

## Explanations

In Python, you can read and write files using various functions and methods. You can open a file in read mode, write mode, or append mode, and you can use the read method to read the contents of a file, and the write method to write to a file. You can also use the close method to close a file after you are done with it. Files are useful for storing and processing large amounts of data, such as text or images.

## Examples

- Opening a file: my_file = open('example.txt', 'r')
- Reading a file: my_file.read()  # returns the contents of the file
- Writing to a file: my_file = open('example.txt', 'w'); my_file.write('Hello World')
