# Subsection 4.2: Introduction to Modules

## Key Concepts

- Modules
- Importing modules
- Standard library modules

## Explanations

Modules are pre-written code libraries that provide additional functionality to Python programs. They can be imported into a program to extend its capabilities. Modules can contain functions, classes, and variables that can be used by the program. The standard library modules are a collection of modules that come with the Python installation and provide a wide range of functionalities, including file input/output, networking, and data structures.

## Examples

- Example: Importing the math module - import math
- Example: Using the math module to calculate the square root - math.sqrt(4)
- Example: Importing a specific function from the math module - from math import sin

## Summary Points

- Modules are pre-written code libraries that extend Python's capabilities.
- Modules can be imported into a program using the 'import' statement.
- The standard library modules provide a wide range of functionalities.
- Modules promote code reuse and avoid code duplication.
- Modules make it easier to distribute and maintain large programs.
