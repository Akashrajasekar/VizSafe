# Subsection 3.1: Conditional Statements

## Key Concepts

- if statements
- elif statements
- else statements

## Explanations

Conditional statements are used in Python to make decisions based on certain conditions. The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. The elif statement is used to check another condition if the initial condition is false. The else statement is used to execute a block of code if all conditions are false. These statements are crucial for controlling the flow of a program and making decisions based on user input or data. For example, a program can use an if statement to check if a user is logged in before allowing them to access certain features. The elif statement can be used to check if a user has a certain role or permission. The else statement can be used to display an error message if all conditions are false.

## Examples

- x = 5; if x > 10: print('x is greater than 10'); else: print('x is less than or equal to 10')
- age = 25; if age >= 18: print('You are an adult'); elif age >= 13: print('You are a teenager'); else: print('You are a child')
- username = 'admin'; if username == 'admin': print('Welcome admin'); elif username == 'user': print('Welcome user'); else: print('Invalid username')

## Summary Points

- if statements are used to execute code if a condition is true
- elif statements are used to check another condition if the initial condition is false
- else statements are used to execute code if all conditions are false
- conditional statements are used to control the flow of a program
- conditional statements can be used to make decisions based on user input or data
