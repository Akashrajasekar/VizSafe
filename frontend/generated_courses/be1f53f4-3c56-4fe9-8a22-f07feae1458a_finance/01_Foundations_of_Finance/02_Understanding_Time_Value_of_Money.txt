# Understanding Time Value of Money

## Key Concepts

- Present value
- Future value
- Time value of money

## Explanations

There are several formulas that can be used to calculate present and future values, including the present value formula and the future value formula. The present value formula is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value, FV is the future value, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods. The future value formula is FV = PV x (1 + r)^n. These formulas can be used to calculate the present and future values of different amounts, and to compare the value of different investment options.

## Examples

- Calculating the present value of a future amount
- Determining the future value of an investment
- Comparing the value of different investment options using present and future values

## Summary Points

- The time value of money refers to the idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future
- The present value of a future amount is the amount that, if invested today, would grow to the future amount
- The future value of an amount is the amount that it will be worth at a future date, based on a given interest rate
