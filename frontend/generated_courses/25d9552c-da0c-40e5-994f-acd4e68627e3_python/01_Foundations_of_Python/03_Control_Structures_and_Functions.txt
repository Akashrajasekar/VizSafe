# Control Structures and Functions

## Key Concepts

- If-Else Statements
- Loops
- Functions

## Explanations

Control structures are used to control the flow of a program, and they include if-else statements, loops, and functions. If-else statements are used to make decisions based on conditions, and they allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly, and they can be used to iterate over a sequence of values. Functions are blocks of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of a program, and they can be used to organize and reuse code.

## Examples

- Using an if-else statement to make a decision: if x > 5: print('x is greater than 5')
- Using a loop to iterate over a sequence: for i in range(5): print(i)
- Defining a function to calculate the sum of a list: def sum_list(numbers): return sum(numbers)

## Self-Assessment Questions

Q: What is the purpose of the if statement in Python?
A: The if statement is used to make a decision based on a condition, and it allows you to execute a block of code if the condition is true.

Q: How do you define a function in Python?
A: You define a function using the def statement, followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses.

Q: What is the purpose of the for loop in Python?
A: The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values, and it allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly.
