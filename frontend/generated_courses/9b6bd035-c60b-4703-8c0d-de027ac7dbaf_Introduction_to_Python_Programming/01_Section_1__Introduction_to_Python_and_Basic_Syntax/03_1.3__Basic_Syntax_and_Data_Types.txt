# 1.3: Basic Syntax and Data Types

## Key Concepts

- Variables
- Data types
- Basic operators

## Explanations

Python's basic syntax involves using variables to store and manipulate data. Variables are names given to values, and they can be used to store different types of data, such as integers, floats, and strings. Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, and dictionaries. Basic operators are used to perform operations on variables and values, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Understanding the basic syntax and data types is essential for writing Python programs.

## Examples

- You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator, such as 'x = 5' to assign the value 5 to the variable x.
- Python's built-in data types include integers, floats, strings, lists, and dictionaries, each with its own set of operations and methods.
- Basic operators can be used to perform operations on variables and values, such as 'x + 5' to add 5 to the value of x.
